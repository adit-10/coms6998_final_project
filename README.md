**EfficientNet Optimization**
- Trained an EfficientNet model on CIFAR-100 

- Quantized the model and used the following quantization techniques:
  - Dynamic Range Quantization
  - Full Integer Quantization
  - Float 16 Quantization

- Pruned the model at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 Sparsity levels

Please refer to EfficientNet.ipynb for EfficientNet Optimization code.
